## Sample Code Snippet
```python
# Import necessary libraries
import os
import random
import sys
from tkinter import *
from tkinter import messagebox

# Define the Bill_App class and its methods
class Bill_App:
    # Constructor method to initialize the application
    def __init__(self, root):
        # Initialize the Tkinter root window
        self.root = root
        # Set the window dimensions and title
        self.root.geometry("1340x750+0+0")
        self.root.configure(bg="#f0f0f0")
        self.root.title("Billing Software")

        # Define UI elements and layout...

    # Other methods for calculating total, displaying billing details, etc.

# Create a Tkinter root window
root = Tk()

# Create an instance of the Bill_App class and pass the root window as an argument
obj = Bill_App(root)

# Start the Tkinter main event loop
root.mainloop()
```
